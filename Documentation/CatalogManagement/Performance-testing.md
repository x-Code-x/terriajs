To measure the speed of access to specific datasets, use the Dataset Testing tool.  To use this:

Add #tools=1 to the end of your Terria URL (for instance, http://nationalmap.gov.au/#tools=1)

1. Open the group you wish to test
2. Click Tools in the menu at the top right
3. Choose settings: All Opened tests every opened group, All Enabled tests only individual datasets that are selected. You can set a specific tile zoom range to test as well.
4. Click Request Tiles.

For each dataset, you will see whether all tiles were successfully retrieved, and the average and maximum response time.
